# Game-Website
## Overview:
A promotional website I designed for the game I created while I was in college.
This website also acts as additonal location I use to share tutorials and open source code that I
have made available from my game to the Roblox community.

Notes:
+ Designed using HTML, SCSS/CSS, Javascript.
+ MVC inspired architecture applied to Javascript.

## Project Goals:
  + Gain a better understanding of MVC coding architecture.
  + Create a functional site to act as download hub for the code I am open sourcing from my game.
  + Create a functional site to promote the game I designed.
