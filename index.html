                        <p>
                            Summer break in 2009, you find yourself standing alone on what appears to be a deserted road, waiting for the bus. Your destination? A peculiar theme park situated high in the mountains. This park is known to be the best in the world, but it strikes you as odd that no one seems to remember how or when it came to be. It's as if it has always existed.<br>
                            <br>
                            Rumors about a vanished ride, two missing people, and strange unexplainable sightings have haunted this amusement park's history for the past decade. Despite these persistent rumors, no one seems to believe in them.<br>
                            <br>
                            However, you have a different plan in mind. You intend to investigate these mysteries and uncover the truth behind them.

                                    However, there seems to be something more that she's searching for at the park.
                                    Perhaps it's the excitement of uncovering something new and unexpected, or maybe she's on a personal mission to discover a hidden truth.

                                    Paul is a tired-looking park-goer who was once known for telling tall tales. Though his stories were often dismissed as mere fabrications, rumors persist that he carries a dark secret.

                                    These days, Paul spends his time quietly at the local cafe. His once-energetic demeanor has been replaced by a sense of weariness, and he often seems lost in thought.

                                    The circumstances surrounding William's disappearance remain a mystery. Some say that he simply wandered off and got lost in the dense forest that surrounds the park, while others believe that it was something more sinister.
